# The Identifier Resolution Server

## Overview

This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.7+

## Usage

To run the server, it is recommended that you create a fresh Python virtual environment using Python 3.7, then
install the following dependencies for the *~/identifiers/server* directory:

```bash
# The 'python' binary is assumed to be 3.7 or better
cd /path/to/translator-modules/ncats/translator/identifiers/server
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Using up a standalone version of the server is as simple as typing:

```bash
python -m openapi_server
```

and opening your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8081/ui/
```

Note that the OpenAPI definition assumes a hostname of http://identifiers for the web form to work. However, 
substituting "localhost:8081" for "identifiers" hostname in the synthesized endpoint calls shown, will allow
you to see the results.

Your OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8081/openapi.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:

```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, from the root directory of the Translator Modules project, type the following:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -f Dockerfile_Shared -t translator_modules_shared .
docker build -f Dockerfile_Identifiers_Server -t openapi_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8081:8081 openapi_server
```

Once again, opening your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8081/ui/
```

should show the interface (same caveats as above).

## Running as an Integral Part of the Translator Module Workflow System (using Docker Compose)

See the [Translator Modules documentation](https://github.com/ncats/translator-modules/blob/master/README.md) 
about how this service is run as a Docker Compose managed service within the Translator Modules Workflow system.
